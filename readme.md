## First project - Timetable improvement
 Goal of this project was to **improve the app visually and making it more user-friendly**. 

My responsibility was **Figma**,   
I did the designing and prototyping. 

We started out quite simple:
 * We gathered together and worked out our plan for the next three days.
 * Went to talk with the teachers for feedback about Tahvel (likes and dislikes, their own ideas).

 And on that note we ended the first day.

 On the **second day** we started doing some actual work:
 * We looked over the feedback once more and depending on that we started sketching out our own version.
 * When the sketch was ready, we started designing in Figma.
 * After we finished the rough design, others were able to start coding while I perfected the design and started to make it in to a working prototype.

 That marked the end of the second day.

 **Third day** was pretty much about finishing touches and figuring out the presentation.

 **Our presentation** was shorter compared to others, but we still managed to go through everything we had to.
 We were the last group to present and by that time, pretty much everybody had left so our audience was thankfully quite small.
